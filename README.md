This is my simple performance-first falling sand simulation written in TS/JS.

**Master branch**: The performance is really good, but the code is literally unreadable spaghetti. Runs steadily at 60fps and 30 tps with 1920*800 world size. 

**OOP1 branch**: Readable code, horrible performance(By that I meant not reaching 30fps, even with 100*100 world size). 

I'm using snowpack as the build system of this project, so if you want to test this out, run ```snowpack dev`` or ```npm run dev``` to startup the dev server.

Archived because I simply gave up on this. If you want criticle code that runs faster than light, you shouldn't use javascript.
